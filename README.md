## Hi there, I'm Juan Cabanela

I recently (Fall 2023) became a professor of [**Computer Science and Information Systems**](https://www.mnstate.edu/academics/colleges-schools/csis/) at [**Minnesota State University Moorhead (MSUM**)](https://www.mnstate.edu/[) after 24 years of being a professor of Physics and Astronomy at a variety of institutions include 17 years at MSUM.

My programming tends to be in the Python programming language (often using Jupyter notebooks) although I have quite a bit of experience with C++, C, Perl, and Bash shell.

- 👨‍🏫 I spent part of Summer 2025 revamping the [headcounts](https://github.com/JuanCab/headcounts-web/) package (originally by Matt Craig) to use a modern dataframe library to handle its data.  I also worked with a student, [Natoli Tesgera](https://github.com/Natoli74), to develop a front-end for this tool which is mostly designed to allow department chairs at my University to track enrollment.
- 🔭 I also spent part of Summer 2025 migrating [Astronomy Interactives](https://github.com/JuanCab/AstroInteractives) to work with [Voici](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voici), allowing me to deploy these interactive applications used in introductory astronomy classes to illustrate astronomical ideas on a static website instead of requiring a Jupyter Server.
- I've also been spending a lot of time investigating machine learning, teaching an introductory course on the topic in Spring 2025 and trying to comprehend out the tools I used in astrophysics evolved into things like LLMs which the students are interested in.
- I’m occasionally contribute to the [stellarphot](https://github.com/feder-observatory/stellarphot) package with Matt Craig.  It is a Python package designed to streamline the process of wide-field stellar photometry.  It is specifically aimed at variable star and exoplanet observations.
