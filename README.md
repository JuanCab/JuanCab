## Hi there, I'm Juan Cabanela

I revcently (Fall 2023) became a professor of [**Computer Science and Information Systems**](https://www.mnstate.edu/academics/colleges-schools/csis/) at [**Minnesota State University Moorhead (MSUM**)](https://www.mnstate.edu/[) after 24 years of being a professor of Physics and Astronomy at a variety of institutions include 17 years at MSUM.

My programming tends to be in the Python programming language (often using Jupyter notebooks) although I have quite a bit of experience with C++, C, Perl, and Bash shell (if you want to call that programming).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the [stellarphot](https://github.com/feder-observatory/stellarphot) package with Matt Craig.  It is a Python package designed to streamline the process of wide-field stellar photometry.  It is specifically aimed at variable star and exoplanet observations.
- 👨‍🏫 I previously worked on [Astronomy Interactives](https://github.com/JuanCab/AstroInteractives), which were a set of Jupyter notebooks that were used in introductory astronomy classes to illustrate astronomical ideas.
